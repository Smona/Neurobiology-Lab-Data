<div class="sectionHeading">Experiments and Observations</div>
<a name="experiment0" /><div class="experimentName">Generate action potentials.</div><ol><li> <b>Press Reset & Run to generate an action potential.</b><br /><div class="block"><div class="blockText">You will see an action potential displayed in the Voltage-vs-Time graph in black and two lines representing the equilibrium potentials for Na and K, ENa and EK, respectively.  Remember that <a href="../../explanations/what_is/equilib_pots.htm"  >equilibrium potentials</a> are calculated from the Nernst equation based on the external and internal concentrations of Na and K. </div><ul><li>The brief stimulating current pulse is shown in green.</li><li>ENa is shown as a red line. </li><li>EK is shown as a blue line.</li></ul></div></li><li> <b>Observe the currents underlying the action potential.</b><br /><div class="block">Press Membrane Current Plots (in the P&amp;G Manager) to bring up the appropriate graph and then run the simulation (press R&R). You will see graphs of the Na and K currents (labeled "Patch INa" and "Patch IK") that flow during the rise and fall of the action potential.</div><div class="block">If you are familiar with voltage clamp experiments, you will note that these action potential current patterns are not the same as those observed with a voltage clamp. The voltage clamp measures currents in response to the relatively simple stimulus of the voltage step (see the <a href="../vclamp/tutorial.htm"  >Voltage Clamping a Patch</a> tutorial); in contrast, the currents flowing during the changing voltage change of an action potential are more complicated.</div></li><li> <b>Now observe the conductances changing during the action potential.</b><br /><div class="block">Press Membrane Conductance Plots (in the P&G Manager) to bring up a graph for plotting the Na and K conductances ("Patch gNa" and "Patch gK") as a function of time. Run the simulation.</div><div class="block">You could not make these observations of conductance with a current clamp or even with a voltage clamp in a real experiment. They may only be calculated.</div></li><li> <b>Question:</b><br /><div class="standardText">What underlies the <a href="./linked_files/ans1.htm"  >depolarizing ramp</a> at the beginning of the action potential?</div></li></ol><a name="naCurrent" /><img src="../../shared_images/rainbow2.gif" class="rainbow" width="540" height="4" alt="rainbow separator" /><br /><a name="experiment1" /><div class="experimentName">Understand the peculiar shape of INa</div><div class="standardText">Why is INa so "kinky" with two phases? Why does it not have a smooth time course since the voltage and gNa&#8212;and even IK&#8212;all have smooth time courses? You can plot the driving force on Na ions to assist your reasoning.
  				</div><ol><li> <b>Plot the driving force on the Na ions (Vm minus ENa) as a function of time.</b><br /><div class="block"><div class="blockText">Press the "Plot Driving Force for INa" button (in the P&amp;G Manager). An appropriate 
graph will appear, overlying the Voltage-vs-Time graph. Run the simulation 
by pressing R&amp;R.</div><ul><li>The red line is ENa.</li><li>The black line is the action potential.</li><li>The brown line is the driving force on Na.</li></ul></div><div class="block">The driving force is large at Vrest (&#8211;120 mV) and decreases almost to zero during the action potential, then falls to an even greater value (&#8211;131 mV) during the undershoot of the action potential. Using the <a href="../../help/crosshairs.htm"  >crosshairs</a> option, click on the driving force trace and read off the time (the <i>x</i>-value) at which the minimum driving force occurs. (Read the value in the bar at the top of the graph.)
						</div></li><li> <b>Find the time at which the minimum (the notch) in INa occurs.</b><br /><div class="standardText">Clearly INa begins to increase, then decreases to a minimum, then increases again. Find the time at which this minimum occurs.  Now find the <i>y</i>-value at that time on the action potential trace.  Can you now explain the <a href="./linked_files/ans2.htm"  >kink</a>?</div></li><li> <b>Measure the size of the peak INa.</b><br /><div class="standardText">Are you perhaps surprised to find that the peak INa actually occurs on the falling phase of the action potential? Keep a note of this peak value for comparison with Na currents in the <a href="../vclamp/tutorial.htm"  >Voltage Clamping a Patch</a> tutorial.</div></li><li> <b>Close the Plot-Driving-Force-for-INa graph.</b><br /><div class="standardText">Close this panel to expose the Voltage-vs-Time graph beneath it for the remainder of the experiments in this tutorial.</div></li></ol><img src="../../shared_images/rainbow2.gif" class="rainbow" width="540" height="4" alt="rainbow separator" /><br /><a name="experiment2" /><div class="experimentName">More questions:</div><ol><li> Would <a href="./linked_files/ans3.htm"  >changing either the length or diameter</a> of the patch alter the action potential in any respect? Should it?<br /></li><li> Does the <a href="./linked_files/ans4.htm"  >location of the stimulating electrode</a> in the patch matter? Should it?<br /></li><li> <div class="standardText">Suppose the membrane's capacitance were doubled. Call up the Patch Parameters panel (in the P&G Manager) and change the value of the capacitance to see how your change would affect the shape of the action potential.</div><ul><li> When you change the capacitance, there will be changes in the rate of rise and in the final amplitude of the depolarization in response to the current pulse. Are these changes compatible with this explanation of <a href="../../equations/capacitance/capcurr.htm"  >capacitive currents</a>?</li><li> Restore the value of the capacitance to its default setting.</li></ul></li></ol><a name="changeTemp" /><img src="../../shared_images/rainbow2.gif" class="rainbow" width="540" height="4" alt="rainbow separator" /><br /><a name="experiment3" /><div class="experimentName">Study the effect of temperature on the action potential and underlying conductances.</div><ol><li> <b>Compare traces at different temperatures.</b><br /><div class="block">Use the "Keep Lines" option in all of the plots (<a href="../../help/plotting_windows.htm#plotsubmenu"  >right mouse button submenu</a>) for comparing traces. You must have your cursor positioned on the graph when you select "Keep Lines."</div><div class="block">Note that your experiments so far have been carried out at 6.3&nbsp;&deg;C, the standard reference temperature for squid, an invertebrate, used by Hodgkin and Huxley. Although the lack of heating in labs in post World War II England has been cited as a reason for this low temperature in their experiments, probably the most important reason was to slow the changes in the ionic currents to the point where the electronic circuits could control the potential more accurately.</div></li><li> <b>Increase the temperature (in Run Control) by 10&nbsp;&deg;C, then 20&nbsp;&deg;C.</b><br /><div class="standardText">You can warm (or cool) the patch by using the "up" or "down" arrows (to the right of the white value field) or by typing a new value into the field using the field editor.</div></li><li> <b>Draw conclusions from this important experiment.</b><br /><div class="standardText">What happens to the <a href="./linked_files/demyel_temp.htm"  >duration</a> of the action potential if you change the temperature? Can you explain your observations by studying the effect of temperature on the underlying conductances? The results of this experiment are crucial for understanding why temperature affects the ability of an action potential to invade demyelinated regions of myelinated nerve (<a href="../demyelin/tutorial.htm"  >Partial Demyelination</a> tutorial).</div></li><li> <b>Return the temperature to its default value of 6.3&nbsp;&deg;C.</b><br /></li></ol><img src="../../shared_images/rainbow2.gif" class="rainbow" width="540" height="4" alt="rainbow separator" /><br /><a name="experiment4" /><div class="experimentName">Bathe the axon in anesthetic agents.</div><ol><li> <b>Be sure that the <a href="../../help/parameters_panel.htm"  >Patch Parameters</a> panel is open so that you can do more experiments.</b><br /><div class="standardText">Click the "Patch Parameters" button (in the P&amp;G Manager) if this panel is not already open.</div></li><li> <b>Partially block both the Na and K conductances.</b><br /><div class="standardText">The anesthetics procaine and lidocaine reduce both the Na and K conductances by almost equal factors. Reduce the values of the conductances (the Na channel density and the K channel density) by a factor of two.</div></li><li> <b>Compare the normal and partially blocked action potentials.</b><br /><div class="standardText">Using Keep Lines, compare action potentials generated at different "concentrations" of anesthetic by continuing to divide by a factor of two. By how much must you reduce the two conductances to block the generation of the action potential? Make a note of this value for comparison with experiments below using selective poisons of each channel type. </div></li><li> <b>Return the Na and K conductances to their default values.</b><br /></li></ol><a name="applyttx" /><img src="../../shared_images/rainbow2.gif" class="rainbow" width="540" height="4" alt="rainbow separator" /><br /><a name="experiment5" /><div class="experimentName">Block the Na channels with the poison <a href="../../explanations/drugs_toxins/ttx.htm"  >tetrodotoxin (TTX)</a></div><ol><li> <b>Block the Na channels.</b><br /><div class="standardText">TTX is a highly specific blocker of Na channels. Mimic the onset of its effects by gradually reducing the value of (only) the Na channel density. Divide repeatedly by a factor of two, as you did above, until the regenerative response disappears. Use Keep Lines to compare the action potentials in normal saline and at different degrees of block of the Na channels.</div></li><li> <b>Question:</b><br /><div class="standardText">Which is more effective at blocking action potentials, a toxin that selectively blocks Na channels or the anesthetics (investigated above) that block both Na and K channels? <a href="./linked_files/ttx_vs_lidocaine.htm"  >Why?</a></div></li><li> <b>Reset the Na channel density to its default value.</b><br /></li></ol><a name="refractoryPeriod" /><img src="../../shared_images/rainbow2.gif" class="rainbow" width="540" height="4" alt="rainbow separator" /><br /><a name="experiment6" /><div class="experimentName">How soon can the neuron fire again after an action potential?</div><div class="standardText">It is well known that there is a period of reduced excitability following an action potential called the "refractory period." During this time, lingering changes in the ionic conductances following one impulse affect the threshold for firing a next impulse. The refractory period limits the frequency of impulses in a train of impulses. </div><ol><li> <b>Deliver two pulses to the patch: the first to evoke an impulse and the second to test the duration of the refractory period.</b><br /><div class="standardText">Set the Total # (ms) to 20. Then bring up a second "Stimulus Control" panel by clicking the button again in the P&G Manager.  This action will put two electrodes into the patch&#8212;the simplest way for NEURON to inject two separately controlled current pulses. The second panel comes up below and offset from the first.</div><div class="block"><ul><li><i>Set the parameters for each pulse.</i>  <ul><li>
										Delay:
										Deliver the first pulse  at <i>t</i> = 0 ms and the second at <i>t</i> = 9 ms.  
									</li><li>
										Duration:
										Keep each pulse at its very short duration (0.15 ms); this duration is approximately the same as that of transmitter-gated conductance changes that occur at fast synapses, explored further in the <a href="../nmj/tutorial.htm"  >Neuromuscular Junction</a> tutorial.
									</li><li>
									Amplitude:
									Initially keep both of the stimulus current amplitudes at 0.2 nA, above threshold for this duration pulse.
									</li></ul></li></ul></div></li><li> <b>Measure how long the membrane is refractory.</b><br /><div class="standardText">When you run the simulation, you should find that the second current pulse, occurring 9 ms after the first pulse, fails to generate a second spike even though the amplitudes of both stimuli are well above threshold for setting up an action potential. Increase the delay of the second pulse until it generates an action potential. By doing this you should get a sense of how long the refractory period lasts.</div></li><li> <b>Determine the degree of refractoriness at various times.</b><br /><div class="block"><div class="blockText">Probe the refractoriness following the spike by decreasing the delay of the second stimulus to 9, 8, 6, 5, and 4 ms and finding the threshold current at each of these times.</div></div><div class="block"><div class="blockText">You should find that you need more and more current to evoke the second action potential as you decrease the time between the two action potentials. No wonder an excitatory synaptic input has trouble generating an action potential when it falls into a refractory period!</div></div></li><li> <b>Question:</b><br /><div class="standardText">The responses to pulses at 6, 5, and 4 ms are particularly interesting. Can you <a href="./linked_files/absolute_refract.htm"  >explain the waveforms</a> of the responses at each of these times?</div></li></ol>
