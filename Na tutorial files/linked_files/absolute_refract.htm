At these times, the brief current pulse initially drives the membrane potential to high values so that there is a high probability that all of the Na channels available for opening are indeed opened.

<div class="subtitle">The relative refractory period</div>

At 6 and 5 ms, the response of the membrane to this voltage change is partially regenerative. The membrane is said to be in a "relative" refractory state.

<br /><br /><br />

<div class="subtitle">The absolute refractory period</div>

At 4 ms, with a large current, you should see only a delayed return to baseline but no appreciable regenerative response: the membrane is said to be in an "absolute" refractory state. The change from "absolute" to "relative" is continuous.
