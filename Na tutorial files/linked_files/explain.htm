As the response lingers at threshold, this conductance slowly rises until a point at which it falls dramatically.  If you measure the Na conductance, you will find that at the point just before it falls this conductance is about 8-fold greater than at rest.  At this point, then, this conductance can assist the second impulse to reach threshold. The K conductance has risen as well during the subthreshold depolarization but only about 2-fold.<br /><br /><div class="subtitle">Testing refractoriness at 8 ms</div>The Na conductance falls, however, as the inactivation process takes over, and after this point it is at a value actually below its resting value. Now a subsequent pulse has a much more difficult job to bring the patch to threshold because not only is the Na conductance lower, the K conductance is still almost double its resting value.<br /><br /></body></html>
