<div class="subtitle">Changes in temperature affect channel transitions.</div>

Changes in temperature affect the rates with which channels open, close, and inactivate and thus the speed with which the ionic conductances turn on and off.  These rates are described by the rate constants in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations which change 3-fold for each 10 &#176;C change: 3-fold faster with warming, 3-fold slower with cooling. 

<br /><br />

The durations of the conductances affect the durations of the currents underlying the action potential and, in turn, the duration of the action potential itself. The duration of the action potential changes with temperature by about the same factor as the changes in the rate constants of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations: 3-fold per 10 &#176;C.

<br /><br />

As the axon is warmed, the duration of the regenerative increase in the Na conductance becomes shorter and shorter. Although the characteristic shape of the action potential is conserved, the amplitude decreases with substantial warming and the falling phase becomes much more rapid.
