<div class="subtitle">Consider the driving force on Na ions.</div>

The reason for this apparent anomaly is that as the action potential approaches the Na equilibrium potential (ENa), the force driving Na ions through the membrane approaches zero. Thus INa is reduced.  As the action potential moves away from ENa in its falling phase, INa again increases, flowing inward through open channels that have not yet inactivated. The surprising result is that the Na current is actually largest during the falling phase of the action potential.

<div class="subtitle">The ionic current equals the conductance multiplied by the driving force.</div>

The Na and K currents you observe in this tutorial obey this <a href="../../../equations/ionic_current_equation.htm">relation</a>, Ohm's Law made relevant to the membrane. It is one of the most useful equations in neurophysiology.
