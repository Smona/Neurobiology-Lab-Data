However, these effects are greater if you halve the Na conductance alone (with TTX) than if you halve both conductances at the same time (with lidocaine or procaine).<br /><br /><br /><div class="subtitle">The Na current loses out to the K current in TTX.</div>When you reduce either conductance, you reduce that ion's current.  Remember that each <link type="equation" filename="ionic_current_equation.htm"> ionic current</link> is determined by (1) the driving force on the ion  and (2) the time course and amplitude of the ion's conductance. The Na and K currents compete in trying to depolarize and repolarize the membrane. Thus the time course and amplitude of the action potential will reflect the changing contributions  of the two currents.<br /><br />From the very moment of the onset of the action potential, the balance of the two currents--their relative amplitudes and their timing--will affect both the rate of rise and the peak of the spike.  Now consider your observations.<br /><br />When the Na conductance is halved by TTX, the rate of rise and the peak of the spike diminish because the Na current diminishes.  But the K conductance retains its normal sensitivity to depolarization. The resulting K current outmatches the depressed Na current and  contributes even more than usual to slowing the rate of rise and diminishing the peak.<br /><br />When <b><i>both</i></b> the Na conductance and the K conductance are halved in lidocaine, the  two currents are more evenly matched. Now both the rate of rise and the peak are larger than their values in TTX.<br /><br /><br /><div class="subtitle">The K current plays a role throughout the impulse.</div>You should discover, then, that changes in the K conductance affect all aspects of the action potential. Although the rate of rise is primarily determined by the amplitude of the inward Na current, it will also be affected by altering the K conductance.  As well, the value of the peak will reflect the values of both conductances. Although the changes in the K conductance (the tortoise) are much slower than that of the Na (the hare), they begin the race at the same time and, with the Na conductance inactivated (the hare out of breath and napping), the K conductance finally restores the membrane to its resting level.<br /><br />
