<div class="title">Does changing either the length or diameter of the patch alter the action potential in any respect? Should it?</div>

You might at first think that increasing the length or diameter of the patch (think of it as an annulus of axon) would increase the surface area of the membrane, increasing the number of channels and the currents through them, and would thus affect the action potential in some way.  Remember, however, that the membrane's capacity, proportional to the area, is also increased.  Such a balance ensures that the shape of the action potential is independent of the area of a uniform patch.
